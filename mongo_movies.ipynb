After discovering from the court\\'s goat soothsayer  that \"a warrior of black-and-white\" would defeat him, Shen then led an army to exterminate the panda population to avert the prophecy. Shen\\'s parents, horrified at this atrocity, exiled a vengeful Shen from the city. Thirty years later,{{cite web}} Po  is living his dream as the Dragon Warrior, protecting the Valley of Peace alongside his friends and fellow kung fu masters, the Furious Five. Master Shifu  tells him, however, he has yet to achieve inner peace. While helping defend a village from wolf bandits who have been stealing refined metal for Lord Shen, Po is distracted by a symbol on the head wolf\\'s ([[Danny McBride  armor, which causes Po to have a flashback of his mother, and allows the wolves to escape. Po asks his goose father, Mr. Ping , of his origins, but all Ping can say is that he found Po as an infant in a radish crate, and adopted him. Shifu receives word that Shen has killed Master Thundering Rhino , the leader of the kung fu council protecting Gongmen City, with a newly developed weapon, a cannon, with which he intends to destroy kung fu tradition and conquer China. He sends Po and the Furious Five to stop Shen, who reach Gongmen City to find it under occupation by Shen\\'s forces. The heroes find two imprisoned council members, Masters Storming Ox  and Croc , and ask for help to liberate the city, but both masters cite their helplessness against Shen\\'s weapon and refuse. The wolf leader discovers Po and the Five and they give chase, only to be captured in front of Shen\\'s tower. Upon being brought before Shen in his tower, Po and the Five free themselves and destroy Shen\\'s cannon. However, Po is again distracted by a flashback upon seeing the same symbol as before on Shen\\'s plumage, allowing Shen to escape and destroy the tower with an arsenal of cannons. After Po and the Five escape, Tigress  confronts Po over his distraction. Po reluctantly explains that he remembers Shen\\'s presence on the night he was separated from his parents, and wants answers from Shen about his past. Though surprisingly empathetic, Tigress tells Po to stay behind for his own safety. Po nonetheless breaks into Shen\\'s cannon factory to confront him, inadvertently foiling the Five\\'s plan to destroy the factory. Shen falsely claims that Po\\'s parents never loved him before he blasts a distraught Po out of the factory into a river while capturing the Five. Po is rescued by Shen\\'s soothsayer, who has been exiled by Shen to the deserted village where Po was born. Guided by the soothsayer to embrace his past, Po remembers that when he was young, his parents had sacrificed themselves to save him from Shen\\'s army, his mother hiding him in a radish crate and luring Shen\\'s forces away from him. Po thus attains inner peace, realizing that he had lived a happy and fulfilling life despite this early tragedy. Po returns to Gongmen City to save the captive Five and prevent Shen\\'s conquest of China. During the ensuing battle , Po uses his inner peace to enable a kung fu technique that allows him to redirect Shen\\'s cannon fire against his own armada, destroying it  Po urges Shen to let go of his own past, but Shen attacks Po until he inadvertently slashes the ropes holding up a cannon which falls and crushes him to death. Victorious, Po returns to the Valley of Peace and reunites with Mr. Ping, lovingly declaring him to be his father. At the same time, Po\\'s aging biological father  is shown to be living in a far-off, hidden village inhabited by surviving pandas, and suddenly senses that his son is alive.'},\n",

Along her journey to the college, she met 17-year-old Liang Shan Bo who was attending the same school. They became sworn \"brothers\" and studied for three years together. Over this period of time, they formed a strong friendship. Ying Tai gradually fell in love with Shan Bo who, being a bookworm, never did discover what she was despite coming across a couple of oddities. When she was summoned home by her father, Ying Tai revealed the truth to her headmaster\\'s wife. Ying Tai requested that she be the matchmaker for her and Shan Bo and gave her a jade pendant as a token to be handed to Shanbo. Shan Bo walked with Ying Tai for 18 miles to send off his sworn brother. She tried several times to hint to him her identity during the journey but to no avail despite insulting him twice in her exacerbation with his denseness. Finally, she found a way and got his consent to matchmake him to her \"twin sister\". She exhorted him to seek out his fiancee\\' soon before they reluctantly took leave of each other at the pavilion where they first met. Upon returning to school, Shan Bo was restless and could not concentrate on his studies in the absence of his sworn brother. Seeing this, the headmaster\\'s wife told him about Ying Tai, gave him the jade pendant and bade him to go propose to her. The joy of the reunion of the two came to naught when Ying Tai told Shan Bo he was three months too late. Her father had already betrothed her to the frivolous son of the powerful and wealthy Ma family. Shan Bo, who was already ailing, was deeply grieved. He returned home and his health steadily deteriorating until he became seriously ill. Several days before her wedding day, he asked to see her again. When his servant returned instead with a token from her, it was the final blow. He sent his servant to Ying Tai with a last gift and died. Ying Tai was stricken with sorrow and forced her father to come to a compromise: to allow her to visit Shan Bo\\'s tomb on the way to her betrothed home or she would not marry. At the tomb, she swore her undying love for Shan Bo and that if they could not be together in life, she would rather be with him in death. A tornado sprang up and an earthquake split the tomb in two whereupon Ying Tai threw herself into it. The whipping winds covered the tomb with sand. When the winds died down, two butterflies were seen soon after, flitting away to the heavens.'},\n",

In addition, her hallucinations also begin to include her acting out Michael\\'s murders, like envisioning herself taping Annie to a chair and slitting her throat while dressed in a clown outfit—similar to how a young Michael murdered Ronnie White. While Laurie struggles with her dreams, Loomis has been going on tour to promote his new book, only to be greeted with criticism from people who blame him for Michael\\'s actions and for exploiting the deaths of Michael\\'s victims. When his book is finally released, Laurie discovers the truth: that she is really Angel Myers, Michael\\'s long lost sister. With the truth out, she decides to go partying with Mya  and Harley  to escape how she is feeling. Michael appears at the party and kills Harley, then makes his way over to the Brackett house and stabs Annie repeatedly.  When Laurie and Mya arrive they find Annie bloodied and dying. Michael kills Mya and then comes after Laurie, who manages to escape the house. While Laurie manages to flag down a passing motorist, Sheriff Brackett arrives home and finds his daughter dead. Laurie gets into the motorist\\'s car, but before they can escape Michael kills the driver and flips the car over with Laurie still in it. Michael takes the unconscious Laurie to an abandoned shed he has been camping out in. Laurie awakens to a vision of Deborah, and a young Michael, ordering her to say \"I love you, mommy\". The police discover Michael\\'s location and surround the shed. Loomis arrives and goes into the shed to try to reason Michael into letting Laurie go. Inside, he has to inform Laurie, who believes that the younger Michael is holding her down, that no one is restraining her and that she must maintain her sanity. Just then, Deborah instructs the older Michael that it is time to go home, and Michael grabs Loomis and kills him by slashing his face and stabbing him in the chest. Stepping in front of a window while holding Loomis\\'s body, Michael is shot twice by Sheriff Brackett and falls into the spikes of some farming equipment. Apparently released of the visions, Laurie walks over and tells Michael she loves him, then she stabs him repeatedly in the chest and finally in the face. The shed door opens and Laurie walks out, wearing Michael\\'s mask. As she pulls the mask off, the scene transitions to Laurie in isolation in a psychiatric ward, grinning as a vision of Deborah dressed in white stands with a white horse at the end of her room.'},\n",

       "  'summary': 'Benjamin \"Benjie\" Santos VIII  comes from a long line of warriors and soldiers. His grandfather, Benjamin Santos VI , expects him to be in the army and to be like his ancestors who fougt every battle in the country. He lives with his parents and two sisters named Jesamine  and Anjamin . His father, Benjamin VII, gave up being a military soldier to be what he wants to be, a scientist and an inventor. As a result, Benjie\\'s grandfather did not agree with his decision, so they were forced to leave his grandfather\\'s house and to never come back. They now live in an antique house, where they started a new life. His father, as expected, followed what makes him happy. He invented gadgets and unique deadly weapons. Some examples are the Fart-gun, or the Utot-gun in Tagalog, a fan that shoots bullets, and a tiara that can kill thousands of people. They went to Benjie\\'s grandfather\\'s 75th birthday, where his grandfather finds out he is actually gay. They were asked to leave and to never show their faces again for they are a disgrace to the Santos family. When a civil war in the Philippines breaks out, Benjie is forced to enlist in place of his ailing father, who was said to have high blood pressure and diabetes. After a long time training, their group was to be dissolved for being not good in training. The group trained in the night, resulting in a very good training in the morning. A group of squadron of enemies of the group, incensed with constantly losing to Benjie\\'s group during training, sought to reveal Benjie\\'s sexuality, by making Benjie drunk and filmed a sex video of him. The following morning, the Highest-General called Benjie for the video, and made him leave the army. When Benjamin was going to leave, his friends joined him, and saying, \"Hindi kami masaya kung wala ka!\" . They leave the army, and on a forest adventure, they hear some trucks and cars moving. They wake up, and follow the cars, resulting in them discovering the location of the enemy base by accident. They go back to the army, and tell the Highest-General about what they saw, but he wouldn\\'t believe them, saying the real enemy base was in Tanay, based on the army\\'s gathered information and instead decided to attack the Tanay base. While the army searches for enemy forces in the Tanay base, they are ambushed by hundreds of terrorists. Meanwhile, Benjie\\'s group returns to the enemy\\'s real base, where they saw the terrorist\\'s trucks with the captured forces, including Benjie\\'s grandfather and Brandon Estolas —the group\\'s former commander in the army. They then make plans to rescue their allies by dressing up as girls to trick the enemy guards into letting them inside their base. Once inside, the group kills many people with the tiara, fan, and Fart-gun Benjie\\'s father invented. As they enter the base, the group split up in different ways. When one of the terrorists spots what he thought was Benjie hiding in a metal barrel, he then tells Abe Sayyep , the squadron commander, about what he saw. Abe Sayyep pulls out the wig Benjie put in the barrel, only to find out it was some sort of trickery. As soon as Benjie finds his grandfather, Brandon, and the other generals, he unties them. Benjie\\'s grandfather thanks him and asks for forgiveness for treating him so badly. Benjie is reunited with the group, where Abe Sayyep appears and shoots at Benjie\\'s grandfather. Benjie jumps in front of his grandfather in order to save him. He sees himself in heaven, and sees his great-grandfathers, who tell him that he did very well and it is not yet the time for him to die. He is soon revived, and the group returns home, where they celebrate their victory with a party.'},\n",

       "  'summary': 'In the future, a totalitarian government employs a force known as Firemen to seek out and destroy all literature, permitting them to search anyone, anywhere, at any time. One of the Firemen, Guy Montag , meets one of his neighbours, Clarisse , a 20-year-old schoolteacher whose job is hanging by a thread due to her unorthodox views. The two have a discussion about his job, where she asks if he ever reads the books he burns. Curious, he begins to hide books in his house, and begins reading them, starting with Charles Dickens\\' David Copperfield. This leads to conflict with his wife, Linda, who is more concerned with being popular enough to be a member of The Family, an interactive television program that refers to its viewers as \"cousins\". At the house of a book collector, the captain  talks with Montag at length about how books change people and make them want to be better than others, which is considered anti-social. The book collector, a middle-aged woman who was seen with Clarisse a few times during Montag\\'s rides to and from work, refuses to leave her house, opting instead to burn herself and the house so she can die with her books. Returning home that day, Montag tries to tell Linda and her friends about the woman who martyred herself in the name of books and calls them out on knowing nothing about what\\'s going on in the world, calling them \"zombies\" and telling them they\\'re just \"killing time\" instead of living life. Disturbed over Montag\\'s behavior, Linda\\'s friends try to leave, but Montag stops them by forcing them to sit and listen to a novel passage. During the reading, one of Linda\\'s friends breaks down crying, now fully aware of the feelings she repressed over the years, while Linda\\'s other friends leave in disgust over Montag\\'s alleged cruelty and the \"sick\" content of the novel. That night, Montag dreams of Clarisse as the book collector who killed herself. That same night, Clarisse\\'s house is raided, but she escapes through a trapdoor in the roof thanks to her uncle. Montag breaks into the captain\\'s office looking for information about the missing Clarisse, and is caught, but not punished. Montag meets with Clarisse and helps her break back into her house to destroy papers that would bring the Firemen to others like her. She tells him of the \"book people,\" a hidden sect of people who flout the law, each of whom have memorized a single book to keep it alive. Later, Montag tells the captain he is resigning, but is convinced to go on one more call,\\xa0which turns out to be Montag\\'s own house. Linda leaves the house, telling Montag that she couldn\\'t live with his book obsession anymore and leaves him to be punished by the Firemen. Angrily, he destroys the bedroom and television before setting fire to the books. The captain lectures him about the books, and pulls a last book from Montag\\'s coat, for which Montag kills him. He escapes and finds the book people, where he views his \"capture\" on television, staged to keep the masses entertained and because the government doesn\\'t want him alive. Montag selects a book to memorize, Tales of Mystery & Imagination by Edgar Allan Poe, and becomes one of them.'},\n",

       "  'summary': 'In 2012, the economy of the US collapses. Unemployment and crime rates skyrocket, and the sharp increase of convicted criminals leads to privatized prisons for profit. The warden of Terminal Island penitentiary, Hennessey , earns profits from the pay-per-view broadcast of a modern gladiator game called “Death Race”, using the prisoners as players. The racers, along with their navigators, drive a 3-part race over 3 days on a closed track at Terminal Island. The reward for the drivers is that any racer who wins 5 races will be granted freedom by Warden Hennessey. At the end of one race, a masked driver named Frankenstein  is nearing the finish line against his only surviving competitor, rival Machine Gun Joe . His navigator, Case , reports that his defensive weapons are malfunctioning, and is ordered to eject from the car just before Joe blows it up. On the outside, Jensen Ames  struggles to live normally and provide for his family in the ruined economy. When the steel factory he works at is closed, he returns home and promises his wife that he will provide for her and their new-born daughter. He is suddenly knocked down by a mysterious assailant - waking up covered in blood, with his wife murdered. He is arrested by the police, finding he has been framed for killing his wife. Six months later Ames has been convicted and sent to Terminal Island. Hennessey informs Ames that – unknown to the public and the other racers – Frankenstein is dead, but as he was so wildly popular, she wants to keep his legend alive for the ratings. She coerces Ames to clandestinely assume the persona, with the inducement that Ames would only need to win one race to earn his freedom and take back his daughter since Frankenstein won four. She points out that, by wearing Frankenstein\\'s mask, only a few inside people will know he\\'s not really Frankenstein, including his maintenance crew of Coach , Gunner , and Lists . On Race Day 1, Ames meets Case, his navigator from the nearby woman\\'s prison , who also knows he\\'s not Frankenstein. Ames has a rough first go, coming in last place after three other racers have been terminated. His defensive weapons mysteriously malfunction, just like the previous Frankenstein\\'s last race. Ames pieces together that one of the racers, Pachenko , was the one who killed his wife at the behest of Hennessey so she could recruit him as Frankenstein\\'s replacement to maintain her pay-per-view profits. On Race Day 2, Ames forces Case to admit that she has been sabotaging Frankenstein’s car on the orders of Hennessey in exchange for her release papers. Case was never meant to kill Frank or Ames, just stop them from winning so Frankenstein could remain in Death Race. Ames causes Pachenko\\'s car to crash, leaves his own car, and breaks Pachenko\\'s neck and temporarily teams up with Machine Gun Joe to destroy a massive 18-wheel tanker with many weapons that Hennessey unexpectedly adds to the race to boost ratings, which kills three more racers before being destroyed. Only Ames and Joe survive Day 2, with Joe now aware that Ames is driving as Frankenstein. The two talk after the race. Hennessey, aware that Ames knows her angle, tries to maintain the ruse of granting him freedom but asks him to consider staying on permanently as Frankenstein. As a precaution, she has an explosive planted under his car for Race Day 3, knowing she can replace Ames with another masked Frankenstein. On Race Day 3 Ames  and Joe escape by driving their vehicles through a weakened wall discovered by examining footage of another racer\\'s demise; Hennessey unsuccessfully tries to activate the bomb, which had already been discovered and removed by Coach and the rest of the maintenance team. Hennessey sends attack helicopters after Ames, Case, and Joe, who make it across the bridge that connects the island to the mainland  and split up. When the helicopters follow Ames under Hennessey\\'s orders, Case offers herself as bait in the Frankenstein costume to repay the old Frank, and because she’d already been given her release papers. She is captured while Joe and Ames escape on a freight train. Hennessey, although furious about the escape, is happy about capturing Frankenstein  and also for her earning millions of dollars from the highly successful pay-per-view. She is given an anonymous gift for her record-breaking ratings; it turns out to be the bomb she originally meant for Ames, with a note saying; \"WARMEST REGARDS, YOUR MONSTER!\". At that moment, Coach remotely detonates the bomb, killing Hennessey, and proceeds to break the fourth wall by looking into the camera and saying \"I love this game\". Six months afterward, Joe, Ames, and his daughter are shown living honestly in Mexico, where they make a living fixing cars at a local used car dealership. Suddenly, Case shows up in her new modified car. Ames then reflects on how no one could love his daughter more than he does, and that she is his chance at something else, which to him is \"all that really matters\".'},\n",

The stove is located in Mickey Mouse\\'s hunting shack  which appears to have been unoccupied for a while. Soon Mickey and Pluto arrive for the hunting season. Pluto soon discovers that the stove is occupied by the chipmunks and helps Mickey build a fire to smoke them out. Chip and Dale realize what is happening and blow out Mickey\\'s matches and roll of newspaper before they can catch the wood on fire. Finally Mickey is about to use a can of kerosene which the chipmunks can\\'t blow out. From a hiding place underneath the stove, the chipmunks burn a hole in Mickey\\'s boot with a match. Mickey assumes that Pluto is to blame and scolds him. Mickey remains unaware of the chipmunks throughout the film. After Mickey leaves to get more wood, Pluto chases Chip and Dale across the room. They lead Pluto across a table and mantle above the fireplace. Pluto accidentally gets his nose stuck in the muzzle of Mickey\\'s rifle which is hanging over the fireplace. As Pluto tries to pull is nose free, he realizes that one of the hooks on which the rifle is mounted is directly in front of the trigger; the more Pluto pulls the more he will cause the gun to go off in his face. Gradually the table which Pluto is standing on with his hind paws starts to slide back. Pluto falls and makes the rifle fire, but rifle\\'s delay is just long enough that Pluto narrowly avoids the bullet. Pluto lands on the floor where the rifle hits him on the head momentarily knocking him unconscious. From the table above Chip and Dale pour ketchup over the dog to make it look as if he is seriously wounded. Suddenly Mickey returns having heard the gunshot, and when he sees Pluto he thinks he is dead. Pluto comes to and first starts to comfort Mickey. But when he sees the ketchup he starts to panic. Mickey hurriedly carries him off to find help. Thus Chip and Dale regain working ownership over the property.This transfer of ownership is the reference of the film\\'s title \"squatter\\'s rights\" which is a form of adverse possession.'},\n",

       "  'summary': 'Ramirez  speaks in a voice-over about stories that his mother told him about the Devil sometimes actively seeking out individuals who have sinned, while they\\'re still alive on Earth. While taking human form, he traps them in a confined place only to turn them against each other, before killing them one at a time. Ramirez explains that the last victim will die in front of his or her loved one to make cynics of them all, and in the end, all will die. He says that the signs are set in motion with a suicide, as that is when the Devil first makes his presence known. This story is abruptly interrupted by a violent suicide of a man who had fallen from the thirty-fifth floor of a Philadelphia office building; the truck he landed on rolls silently away from the scene. Detective Bowden  is a recovering alcoholic who is assigned to the case of the suicide. He later explains that the reason for his alcoholism was the hit and run death of his wife, and toddler son, five years prior, in which the perpetrator was never apprehended, leaving behind only a coupon ticket for a car wash with the words \"I\\'m so sorry\" written on the back. When he investigates the suicide, he determines that the truck originated from an office building down the block from where the victim was found. Meanwhile, five strangers board an elevator, which becomes stuck between floors just shortly after starting up to the upper floors. When security finds them, they notice that there is CCTV and a radio with which they can call into the elevator, but they have no way of hearing the passengers in return. Bowden takes the investigation regarding the elevator as it is the same building from which the suicide victim jumped. Ramirez is revealed to be one of the security guards and is disturbed by an image of what looks like a screaming face frozen on the video monitor that flashes away. His boss Lustig  dismisses the superstitious suspicions and sends repair technician Dwight  to investigate the elevators while Bowden tries to ascertain the identities of the individuals. Only four of the five are accounted for: Vince McCormick , a sleazy mattress salesman known for investments and frauds; Sarah Caraway , the wife of a rich man who is a pathological liar and plans to leave her husband and take his money; Ben Larson , a temporary security guard with a history of violence, who is in only his second day on the job; Jane Kowski , an older woman who is seen on video to be a thief, and another man who later introduces himself as Tony , who does not appear to have signed in at the security desk. The power goes out in the elevator and the lights start flashing. When they come on, Sarah appears to be wounded with what appears to be a bitemark. All suspicion is initially focused on Vince who has been edgy since the ride began. The lights start flashing and losing power, Sarah becomes queasy and sees a vision of everyone around her in the elevator slaughtered on the floor, even herself. There is another power failure and when the lights are back to focus, Vince is seen dead, thrown into the mirror only to have his jugular vein sliced. The others watch in horror as he dies, forcing Bowden to consider this a murder scene. Dwight attempts to rappel down the elevator shaft via a pulley to try to fix the elevator, but Ramirez says that the Devil will stop any attempts to help his victims, and Dwight\\'s strap comes loose when he is knocked over by a flock of bats and plummets to the roof of the elevator, killing him and further scaring the people. The power goes out again and screams are heard from everyone. When it comes back, Jane is found hanging from the ceiling from a light cable, dead, causing both Sarah and Ben to accuse Tony while Tony swears his innocence. Tony then releases her from the cables that hang her from the ceiling, causing her body to fall to the floor. Lustig goes to investigate the power in the basement and there finds a loose power cable that appears to be the cause of the elevator malfunction, but he is viciously electrocuted trying to fix the issue. Meanwhile in a men\\'s room adjacent to the main lobby, Bowden finds a set of tools that Tony had brought in and briefly suspects he might be responsible for sabotaging the elevator. His suspicions then turn to Ben when he realizes that the building\\'s security company, Caraway Security, is owned by Sarah\\'s husband. Aware of Ben\\'s violent past, he becomes convinced that Ben was hired to kill Sarah by her husband to keep her from leaving him broke, and that the two other murders were orchestrated to make the entire episode appear as a random serial killing. However Ben himself becomes the victim of the next blackout, when he winds up on the floor with his neck twisted around grotesquely, leaving the police further horrified and baffled. The two remaining survivors, Sarah and Tony, face off with each other, but lower their weapons after Detective Bowden calms them down over the loudspeaker. Then there is another blackout and Sarah\\'s throat is cut. As she stuggles to breathe in Tony\\'s arms, a woman claiming to be Tony\\'s fiancee is brought before Bowden and informs him that Tony\\'s last name is \"Janekowski\", and that he is in the building for a job interview, thus eliminating the possibility of the old woman\\'s name being Jane Kowski. As they realize this, the dead body of the old woman rises up behind Tony, pupils dilated and revealing herself to be the Devil. Tony tries to bargain with her to save Sarah\\'s life and sacrifice his own; she scoffs at this, revealing that she\\'s going to kill him anyway. In a last, desperate plea for forgiveness, Tony, using a radio, confesses to a hit and run five years earlier: while drunkenly reaching for beer in his car, he smashed into another car and killed a woman and her child. He says over the radio that he is \"so sorry\" and Bowden realizes that Tony was the one who killed his family . Bowden realizes that Ramirez was right about him having been meant to be the audience to this. The Devil, powerless now that Tony has repented of his sin, curses before vanishing, and the elevator comes back on line, leaving Tony\\'s life spared. Bowden offers to take Tony into custody for the confession, and while en route, informs him who he is. But despite saying he\\'d gone over what he\\'d say, or what he would do if they\\'d ever cross paths, he forgives Tony. Ramirez, again in a voice-over, says that his mother always reassured him at the end of her stories, \"If the Devil is real, then God must be real too.\"'},\n",

       "  'summary': \"The story of Maharana Pratap starts from the narrator Kaviraj Shyamaldas who narrates the cepi of Maharana Pratap and initiates the history of Mewar kingdom. When Vallabhi  was attacked by the Maan Mori in a battle attempt, Rawal Mahendra-II died and his queen Pushpawati somehow escaped from that attack and went to Nagda area . Later she died, giving her child to a Brahmin family. The son of the queen Pushpawati grew young and was popularly known as Bappa Rawal . One day Bappa Rawal met Maharshi Harti Rashi  and by the profound blessings of the sage Harit Rashi, Bappa established the Great kingdom of Mewar. Narrator Kaviraj Shyamaldas proceeds further in the story as- Rana Ratan Singh's wife queen Padmini, who was an iconic paramount of beauty in historical times, faced bad consequences due to Allauddin Khilji's intrigue and deception of forceful control over Chittorgarh as well as over queen Padmini. At the end the conflict between Padmini and Allauddhin Khilji led the last queen Padmini to sacrifice herself for the self-respect and honor of the dynasty by jumping alive in the heap of fire inside the palace at fort Chittor . Narrator Kaviraj Shyamaldas's pen stops at the incident of king Udai Singh's feeding mother Panna Gurjari. The maid's son Banveer  who killed Rana Vikramaditya, was intending to kill Udai Singh in his childhood as well. Pannadhay then sacrificed her own son who was at the same age of Udai Singh and Banveer killed her son by having an impression that sleeping child is Udai Singh. She saw her own son dying in front of her eyes. This sacrifice of Pannadhay is remembered in the history, which ultimately saved the dynasty of Mewar. As the story goes further. Maharana Udai Singh, father of Maharana Pratap was compelled to depart the fort of Chittorgarh. On the other hand, queen Jaiwnti bai who was the first wife of Maharana Udai Singh was facing ignoring attitude by Udai Singh. The Maharana Udai Singh was immensely fascinated towards queen Bhattiyani. The diplomatic queen Bhattiyani passionately devised a plan to establish Jagmal  on the throne of Mewar so as to make him the king. After the death of Udai Singh, the elder son Pratap was not offered the royal seat of the kingdom of Mewar. In the meantime all the noble heads came to know about Jagamal being made the heir. Apparently ministers within the kingdom discussed the dismissal of Jagmal. Rawat Krishna Das and Rawat Sanga suggested that “pratap is the eldest son, and worthy also, hence, he should be the Maharana.” After completing the last rites, the noble chieftains helped Pratap to occupy the Royal Throne and spoke to Jagamal – “In your capacity as the younger brother, your seat is in front of the Royal Throne”. Thus, on 28 feb, 1572; Pratap's coronation was performed at Gogunda  just after the funeral pyre of Udai Singh. Pratap's coronation was held at Rana Bawari and he was enthroned on royal seat of the kingdom of Mewar unanimously in 1572. Maharana Pratap was leading forward with his knighthood, chivalry and art of battling; at the same time emperor Jalal ud-Din Muhammad Akbar of Mughal dynasty  was now ready to tackle the conflict in the form of a battle. However as a diplomat, his strategy was to avoid the battle and motivate other kings to surrender in front of him, but Maharana Pratap was an exception. Pratap won the battle of Gorwar. Akbar with his kingdom oriented strategies sent many proposals to Mewar as Akbar was of the opinion that Mewar is the biggest hurdle in the path of expanding the domain of his kingdom. A special delegation was sent by Akbar thrice to persuade and convince Maharana Pratap that he shall accept the Mughal rule and Mewar should work under Akbar's imperial kingdom. The special deligation consisted of Rana Bhagwandas, Todermal and Man Singh. They requested Maharna Pratap to accept Akbar's proposal. When Kunwar Man Singh of Amber came to Udaipur. There was a grand dinner organized at the bank of lake Udaisagar. But Maharana Pratap decided not to attend that dinner. Pratap sent his son Kunwar Amar Singh to dine with Kunwar Man Singh, which ultimately led to an argument between Dodhia Bhim & Man Singh. This incident precipitated the Mughal-Mewar conflict. Aftermath of this argumentation was the battle of Haldighati. Battle of Haldighati The Mughals marched south towards the village of Haldighati where a pass accessed the terrain of Pratap Singh and his temporary capital of Kumbhalgarh. Emperor Akbar decided to fight a battle and invaded Mewar. Emperor Akbar sent Man Singh as a Chief of his Imperial army and this incident is popularly known as the battle of Haldighati. It took place on 18 June 1576. In the month of June with boiling temperature, battle started in the narrow path of valley. Pratap attacked on Man Singh but he hid himself under the shelter of seating stands on elephant rider, thereby only rider was killed. In this battle Hakim Khan Suri, Rawat Netsingh, Jhala Maan, Jhala Bida, Gwalior's king Raamshah Tanwar, Nalwahan, Shaliwahan were killed as martyrs. Here Pratap was surrounded by Mughal imperial army, at the same time Jhala Maan traded the crown with Pratap. Jhala Maan set a unique example of loyalty, bravery and courage by sacrificing his life to save the life of Pratap. Jhala Maan holding royal insignia urged Pratap to leave the battlefield. Pratap's horse Chetak was wounded by the sword, which was hidden in the trunk of Man Singh's elephant. Ultimately Chetak died while crossing the terrain. Chetak equally shares the respect that has been given to the legendary warrior Maharana Pratap in the history. In the textbooks the battle ends within three hours of a short span, but the fact is that the battle of Haldighati which started on 18 June 1576, actually carried about a month long and ended at Gogunda. The battle was truly a symbol of the raw courage, an epitome towards nation's love, spirit of sacrifice and loyalty of the Rajputs towards the defence of their motherland. It was one of the toughest times for Mughal army as they were compelled to eat unripe mangoes and horse's meat and were forced to leave Mewar at last. Maharana Pratap displayed indomitable courage and bravery in the battle of Haldighati, he won the battle of Haldighati finally displaying the apocalyptic and splendiferous attitude of a true knight. Akbar invaded the land of Mewar many times but Rana Kika  never surrendered in front of him. Under the leadership of Shahbaz Khan, Mewar was invaded umpteen number of times but Pratap escaped from every attempt of Mughals. In the Diwer valley, enormous battle took place between Mughals and Mewar. Maharana Pratap confronted 40 Mughal's cantonment and Mughal army faced extreme defeat. At the end Maharana Pratap established the capital of Mewar named 'Chawand' in Mewar area and promoted agriculture, music & art. Further leading towards success in his serene, sublime and peaceful kingdom. There came an immense tragic and disheartening day in the life of Pratap when while tightening the string of a bow with arrow, a muscle contracted in the intestine causing internal bleeding. Pratap fell down on the surface and died in Chawand.\"},\n",

       "  'summary': '{{Plot}} The Bell Witch haunting began in 1817, as John Bell, a well liked farmer and religious leader, was inspecting his crops and noticed something bizarre. He saw a creature resembling a mixture of a dog and rabbit, and quickly fired at the beast. However, the strange creature vanished before his eyes. Terrifying events would soon follow. It started with the Bells hearing \"beating\" sounds on the outside walls of their house. Soon other unexplained noises were heard around the Bell house such as scratching and knocking sounds.  Over time the Spirit seemed to be growing in strength, from subtle poltergeist-type activity to loud sounds such as dogs and cats fighting, chains being dragged, furniture moving and physical attacks such as scratching, spitting, pulling hair and slapping. A gurgling noise turned into whispers. It sounded like faint, whispering voices—too weak to understand—but seeming to be a feeble old woman crying or singing hymns. The voice grew in strength over months and images started being seen: a girl sitting in a tree, then gone; a deformed dog, then gone; a dead family walking, then gone. The encounters escalated and the Bells’ daughter, Betsy, began experiencing brutal encounters with the entity. It relentlessly pulled her hair and slapped her, often leaving visible prints on her face and body for days at a time. The evil disturbances grew over the next year to the point that it was time for John Bell to share his \"family trouble\" with his friends and neighbors to try to put an end to it. John first told his neighbor and closest friend, James Johnston, a pious man who dismissed the noises as someone playing tricks, the wind or some such thing; but he assured John if there was an unnatural reason for the noises, “with the help of God, they would send this devil back where it belongs”. Johnston quickly changed his mind about the cause of the disturbances and the ease in which it would be sent away later that night when he met his adversary. All of Johnston’s efforts to rid the Bell family of their visitor proved fruitless, even when he brought in a close friend, Reverend Gunn, a fiery Methodist minister. The activity increased, especially in the girls’ room, where it came in the darkness of night and the victims only had candlelight to protect themselves. The creature horrified its victims with noises that happened with no source, snatching their hair and ripping their covers away from the bed. The light was blown out and a touch or cold breath was felt, or worse the unseen attacker left its mark, but vanished when the light returned. Word soon got out and began to spread about the activities. As the haunting gained notoriety, investigators and curiosity seekers from all over the country came to the Bell’s house to speak with the Spirit, which was heard almost nightly. Over time, its voice strengthened to the point that it was loud and understandable. It sang hymns, quoted scripture, carried on intelligent conversation and once quoted word-for-word two sermons that took place at the same time thirteen miles apart. During none of this time did anyone know who or what the entity was, or its purpose for tormenting the Red River settlement. The Spirit took on different personalities. It seemed to like some people and at times even took on an angelic personality. At other times, it was demonic and viciously attacked people and cursed wildly, as it did every time it would see John Bell. When asked who it was and where it came from, it always gave different answers. But one night, when it was asked when it would leave, the Spirit answered “not until it sees John Bell good and dead in his grave”. When asked why, it refused to answer. Future President Andrew Jackson is said to have even visited the Bells\\' home. One of Bells’ sons had served under Jackson during the war. It is said that as Jackson‘s party was approaching the Bell home, one of his companions began to boast how he could defeat the Spirit. The wheels of the wagons suddenly locked up and no matter what the drivers tried they could not get the wagons rolling. Then the men heard a voice say, \"Go on, old General,\" and the wagons began to move once again. Jackson and his men were harassed the entire night of their stay, being slapped and pinched by the Spirit until daybreak. They left as early as they could and never returned. The Spirit turned its vengeance not only toward John Bell, but also his daughter, Betsy, and her engagement to Joshua Gardner, which the Spirit vowed to put an end to. It attacked Betsy constantly when she would see or speak of Joshua. John tried to move Betsy away, but the evil intruder only followed her, forcing her to return. Angered by the treatment of Betsy, Frank Miles, the strongest man in Robertson County and John Jr.’s best friend, confronted the Spirit when it was attacking and cursing Betsy, whom he lovingly referred to as “Little Sister”. Frank quickly found he was no match for the Spirit, who beat him brutally. To Betsy and everyone’s heartbreak, she broke her engagement with Joshua and he soon left town never to see Betsy again. After Joshua left, Lucy, John’s kind and much loved wife, became very ill and was not expected to live. To everyone’s amazement the vile creature was saddened and refused to leave Lucy’s side. It dropped grapes and nuts into Lucy’s lap apparently from nowhere and encouraged her to eat. It sang old gospel hymns to her and rejoiced at Lucy’s recovery. The \"Spirit\" continued to express its dislike for \"Ol\\' Jack Bell,\" and relentlessly vowed to kill him. After years of torment, John Bell’s health diminished as the Spirit continued to mentally and physically abuse him causing him often to be gripped by seizures. In a final effort, a well known voodoo man named Dr. Mize was called in to try to rid the house of its hideous visitor. The man ended up fleeing, begging for mercy; as did all the others who came to combat the Spirit. Shortly after Dr. Mize left, John was viciously attacked by the Spirit. He told his son he could fight no more and was helped to bed. He never left it again. On the morning of December 20, 1820, after a long battle with a crippling nervous system disorder, John Bell took his last breath. Immediately after Bell’s death, the family found a small vial of unidentified liquid beside his bed. John Bell, Jr. gave some of the liquid to the family’s cat and the cat died almost instantly. The \"Spirit\" suddenly spoke up exclaiming, \"I gave Ol\\' Jack a big dose of that last night and that fixed him!\" John Bell’s funeral was one of the largest ever seen in Robertson County, hundreds of people attended; including the gloating Spirit, who cheerfully offered mourners a concert of bawdy drinking songs. The Bell’s house, a religious center for revivals and Bible studies, became a place of fear and terror. A home of torment for John, Lucy and their seven children. A place of suffering as John’s family and friends watched helplessly as a good husband, father and friend withered away while the Spirit did as it liked. Yet, it was said, that those who witnessed the demonstrations knew that the Spirit had a wonderful power of intelligence, possessing great knowledge of men and things; a spirit that apparently could tell men’s secrets, repeat sermons, sing every song in the hymn book and quote scripture fluently with absolute accuracy.'},\n",

       "  'summary': 'In 1879, a communiqué from Lord Chelmsford to the Secretary of State for War in London, narrated by Richard Burton, details the crushing defeat of a British force at the hands of the Zulus at the Battle of Isandlwana. The next scene jumps to the aftermath of the battle showing the scattered bodies of dead British Soldiers amongst the burning tents and supply wagons whilst the victorious Zulus walk amongst them and gather their rifles. At a mass Zulu marriage ceremony witnessed by missionary Otto Witt  and his daughter , Zulu King Cetewayo  is also informed of the great victory earlier in the day. A company of the British Army\\'s 24th Regiment of Foot, a Welsh regiment, is using the missionary station of Rorke\\'s Drift in Natal as a supply depot and hospital for their invasion force across the border in Zululand. Upon receiving news of Isandhlwana from the Natal Contingent Ardenoff and that an army of 4000 Zulu Warriors are advancing their way, Lieutenant John Chard  of the Royal Engineers assumes command of the small British detachment, being senior by virtue of his commission date to Lieutenant Gonville Bromhead , who, as an infantry officer, is rather put out to find himself subordinate to an engineer. Realising that they cannot outrun the Zulu army, especially with wounded soldiers, Chard decides to fortify the station and make a stand, using wagons, sacks of mealie, and crates of ship\\'s biscuit. When Witt becomes drunk and starts demoralising the men with his dire predictions, causing the soldiers of the Natal Native Contingent to desert, Chard orders him to be locked in a supply room. As the Zulu impis approach, a contingent of Boer horsemen arrives. They advise Chard that defending the station is hopeless before they flee, despite Chard\\'s desperate pleas for them to stay. Finally the Zulu Army arrives across the Oscarberg and seconds later a Zulu infantry approaches to within 100 yards of the station and the warriors start rattling their spears against their shields and then charge. The British open fire and manage to kill at least 60 but Ardenoff informs them that the Zulus are counting the soldiers guns and testing their firepower. Then the soldiers escort Witt and his daughter to their carriage and try to get rid of them but Witt starts screaming the soldiers inevitable fate \\'You\\'re all going to die\\' once they finally leave the reality for the soldiers begins to sink in and its for the first time that they are starting to feel incredibly frightened of what awaits them. As this is happening the soldiers realise that there aren\\'t enough men at the north wall of the station as they realise that they are going to be hit everywhere at once. As the soldiers take up their positions Zulu riflemen take their positions and open fire on the station from the neighbouring hillsides. Over the next few hours, wave after wave of Zulu attackers are repelled. The Zulus do succeed in setting fire to the hospital, leading to intense fighting between British patients and Zulu warriors as the former try to escape the flames. Malingering Private Henry Hook  surprises everyone by taking charge in the successful breakout. Attacks continue into the night. The next morning, the Zulus approach to within several hundred yards and begin singing a war chant; the British respond by singing \"Men of Harlech\". In the final assault, just as it seems the Zulus will finally overwhelm the tired defenders, the British soldiers fall back to a tiny redoubt that Chard had earlier ordered constructed out of mealie bags. With a reserve of soldiers hidden within the redoubt, they form into three firing ranks, and seamlessly pour volley after volley into the stunned wave of attacking natives, who are completely annihilated. The rest of the Zulu forces withdraw. After sustaining no attacks for three whole hours, the defenders are still recovering when the Zulus reform again on the Oscarberg. Just when the exhausted defenders are resigned to being wiped out, the Zulus instead sing a song to honour the bravery of the defenders, and then peacefully leave. The film ends with another narration by Richard Burton, listing the defenders who received the Victoria Cross, including Private Hook. Eleven were awarded for the fighting at Rorke\\'s Drift.'},\n",

       "  'summary': ' In San Fernando, California, two gravediggers are filling the grave of the young wife of an unnamed old man. Hearing a strange noise, they decide to leave the cemetery but are attacked and killed by the resurrected corpse of the young woman. Meanwhile, in the skies nearby, a pilot named Jeff Trent and his co-pilot Danny encounter a flying saucer. Absorbed in his grief over his wife\\'s death, the old man walks into the path of an oncoming automobile. At his funeral, mourners discover the bodies of the gravediggers. Inspector Daniel Clay and other police officers come to the cemetery to investigate. While searching the graveyard, Clay encounters the female zombie, now joined by the reanimated corpse of the old man, and is killed. Jeff Trent is watching the cemetery with his wife, Paula, and tells her about his flying saucer encounter, stating that the Army has sworn him to secrecy. He suspects the events at the cemetery are related to his encounter with the UFO. A powerful wind knocks everyone to the ground, and a spaceship lands nearby. In the weeks that follow, newspaper headlines report other flying saucer sightings. The military, under the command of Col. Thomas Edwards, Chief of Saucer Operations, attacks the alien spaceships, which flee Earth. Edwards reveals that the government has been covering up the flying saucers, and wonders if the aliens are connected to other disasters on Earth. The aliens return to Space Station 7 for regeneration. Their commander, Eros, informs their ruler that he has attempted, unsuccessfully, to contact the governments of Earth. He says that to force the people of Earth to acknowledge his people\\'s existence, he is implementing Plan 9, which involves resurrecting the recently dead by stimulating their pituitary and pineal glands. The three alien ships return to Earth. Trent is about to leave home for another flight. Concerned for Paula\\'s safety, he urges her to stay with her mother while he\\'s gone, but she insists on staying home. That night, the corpse of the old man rises from his crypt and sneaks into their house. Joined by the corpse of his wife and the newly resurrected Daniel Clay, he chases Paula through the cemetery. Paula collapses and is found by a passing motorist. All three zombies return to Eros\\'s ship, which lifts off. At the Pentagon, Gen. Roberts informs Edwards that the government has been receiving messages from the aliens. Roberts plays the last message, which has been translated into English by a recently invented \"language computer\". The general sends Edwards to San Fernando, California, where most of the aliens\\' activities have occurred. In California, the police interview the Trents about their experiences with the aliens. Unbeknownst to them, the alien saucer has returned to the graveyard. While waiting by the police car, Officer Kelton encounters the old man. The old man chases the officer to the Trents\\' yard, where they shoot him, with no effect. The nearby aliens strike the old man with a ray, causing his body to decompose, leaving only his skeleton. Not knowing what to make of this, the Trents and the police decide to drive to the cemetery. Eros and fellow alien Tanna send Clay to kidnap Paula in order to lure the other three to their spaceship. Meanwhile, seeing a glow in the distance, Trent and the police head toward the ship. Kelton stays with Paula, but is incapacitated by Clay. Upon awakening, he calls for help, and Officer Larry comes to aid him. Eros allows Trent and the police to enter, and they board with guns drawn. Eros tells them that human weapons development will inevitably lead to the discovery of solarbonite, a substance that has the effect of exploding \"sunlight molecules\". A solarbonite explosion would set off a chain reaction that would destroy the entire universe. Eros believes humans are too immature to not use this power, and intends to destroy mankind to prevent this. Outside the ship, Clay arrives with Paula. Eros threatens to have her killed if they try to force him to go with them. Officers Kelton and Larry arrive and spot Clay with Paula. Realizing their guns are useless, they approach Clay from behind with a stick. Eros sees this and shuts off the ray controlling Clay, allowing Paula to go free. A fight ensues between Eros and Jeff, during which the ship\\'s delicate equipment is damaged, setting off a fire. The humans flee the ship, and Tanna flies it into the atmosphere. The flaming ship explodes with both aliens. As a consequence of the explosion, Clay and the female zombie are decomposed in the same manner as the old man.'},\n",

His children and especially his wife are bored with the trip and uninterested in any family togetherness, despite his insistence. As the family is traveling back home, Griffin is driving the car while his wife and kids are being hauled in the camper behind him. He has a flashback to a doctor\\'s visit where he is told that he has an inoperable form of terminal melanoma and will soon die, which is assumed to have been the motivating factor behind his initiative to take the trip, which his family had talked about doing before he and his wife separated. After becoming increasingly frustrated at his family\\'s apathy about the trip, their reviling attitude toward him, and their trivial demands such as that he stop to walk the dog, he detaches his car from the camper and drives away, deserting them. Sarah Phoenix  is introduced as she is receiving news from her doctor that she also has a terminal disease, leukemia. She is in denial regarding the diagnosis, and following an angry outburst she consults another doctor who delivers the same information. Griffin is seen driving to Los Angeles, where he meets with his brother George  who updates him on his ex-wife and children and gives him $1,500 to spend at his leisure. Faced with his grim diagnosis, Griffin expresses his interest in a course entitled \"Psychological Processes of Death and Dying\", which he attends. Phoenix is also in attendance at this class, and it is where the two characters first meet. After class, Griffin asks Phoenix to meet him the following Wednesday night for dinner if she was interested. She is guarded and shows a lack of interest in developing a close relationship with Griffin due to her terminal illness, and instead of showing up for the date she spies on Griffin from the neighboring restaurant, where he spots her and invites her over. Griffin and Phoenix spend the next several weeks together falling in love and living their lives to the fullest, engaging in fun but outrageous and childish public behavior and constantly switching between an on-again and off-again relationship. Among their activities include sneaking into a movie theater, freighthopping, riding amusement park roller coasters and evading police after being caught painting messages on a water tower, where Phoenix writes \"Class of \\'59\" and Griffin secretly writes \"Griffin Loves Phoenix\" encased in a heart and arrow design. Neither knows that the other is also terminally ill until Phoenix discovers books related to cancer, death and dying in Griffin\\'s apartment, and bursts out at him in rage under the mistaken assumption that he had been stalking her and knew she was terminally ill. She tries to run away, and when Griffin catches her and questions her they both learn of each other\\'s shared impending deaths. Phoenix tells Griffin that when she becomes too ill to continue living a normal life, she will resign herself to a hospital and she does not want him to come and find her. That day finally comes; Griffin finds a note from Phoenix telling him that her pain was too unbearable, and that he should go spend time with his family and remember his promise not to try and find her. Distraught, Griffin seeks her out and finally finds her after searching at over a dozen hospitals, where he sits by her bedside and they comfort each other. Unable to handle the emotional distress of Griffin\\'s presence, Phoenix asks him to leave, which he does, presumably never to return before her death. We then see Griffin browsing a cemetery, where he finds Phoenix\\'s gravestone that under her name and dates of birth and death reads: \"P.S. – Hi Griffin. Thought you\\'d probably drop by\". The film ends as we see a maintenance man painting over Phoenix\\'s and then Griffin\\'s water tower messages.'},\n",

When Jane and Steve go after him, they become trapped along with the manager and a waitress when the Blob – now an enormous red mass from the people it consumed– engulfs the diner. It begins to ooze in through the windows, forcing those trapped inside to seek refuge in the cellar. The police try to kill the Blob by dropping a power line onto it, but the Blob is unaffected and the diner is set ablaze. Dave suggests to put the diner out. Steve notices the Blob crawling down the stairs and blocking the windows. Steve picks up Jane\\'s brother, then Jane tells him to lay his head down, kissing him and he is fast asleep. Steve, Jane and Danny join in a group hug. Later, the manager uses a CO2 fire extinguisher on the fire. Steve notices that it also causes the Blob to recoil. Then he remembers that the creature also retreated from the icebox. He manages to tell Dave about the Blob\\'s vulnerability to cold . Jane\\'s father, Mr. Martin , takes Steve\\'s friends to the high school to retrieve enough fire extinguishers to first drive the Blob away from the diner, then freeze it. Dave requests an Air Force jet to transport the Blob to the Arctic, where it is parachuted to the ice. The film ends with the words \"The End\", which end up morphing into a question mark—suggesting that the Blob may return, ending the film with a cliffhanger.'},\n",

       "  'summary': \" Luis  is a successful policeman who was recently awarded for his skill in investigations despite his track record of being reckless and not following Protocols. After his award ceremony, the chief of police is approached by a woman asking for new information about her daughters who went missing 12 years ago. Luis asks the name of her daughters so he can try and find them. The woman tells him that their names are Joy and Lara Luna. Asking his partner to retrieve the missing persons file and despite his colleague, Greg, telling him not to give the woman false hopes, he sets out for his investigation.  Ella  snuck out at night with her cousin Janine  and Brian , Janine's boyfriend to take the car belonging to Janine's mom so that the three could find somewhere quiet to learn to drive better. Ella and Brian are on bad terms because of Brian's alleged cheating on her cousin and are thus always arguing. Brian was teaching Janine how to drive for her driver's test. As the three of them drive on the highway they spot a patrol car. They panic because they don't have drivers licences. Brian tries to make a U-turn, but he accidentally drives into a fence blocking a dirt road. He gets out to check for damage and notices a gate which he opens and then gets back in the car and continues to drive down this isolated road, thinking it would be the perfect spot for them to learn to drive. As the three switch places in the car, they notice a red car which keeps on overtaking them although they never overtook it, they can't work out how it keeps getting behind them. What's worse is they notice that the car doesn't seem to have a driver. Panicking, Brian tries to get them out of the road but are in an endless loop, passing by the same tree again and again. Finally, the car stalls and Brian and Janine gets out of the car but Ella stays behind in the car. Janine tries to convince Brian to go back for her cousin but Brian refuses to do so and instead promises Janine that they will go back for her with help. As the two walk through the woods, they spot a crashed red car. Meanwhile, finally panicking, Ella leaves the car and manages to catch up with the two. Ella manages to call her father and begs for help but are then forced to leave the location and crash site that she told her father about because the car they were waiting beside suddenly bursts into flames. The three run but the two girls are separated from Brian. They manage to get back to their car but a ghost scares Janine, who was behind the wheel. Ella, in a panicked state of mind, accidentally opens her car door and falls out of the car while Janine loses control and hits her head on the wheel. As Ella opens her eyes, she screams upon seeing the ghost of a burned woman looking down at her. A few hours later, Ella's father, Luis and some officers, appear at the same road. They find Brian dead by the corn fields and it is revealed that Janine died when she hit her head on the wheel but they are unable to find Ella. Luis and Officer Allan find a house deep within the woods. Officer Greg tells them that he already searched the house and tells them that Ella isn't there. They also find the crashed car that the three teens passed by earlier. When Luis opens the backseat door, he sees a skeleton wearing a heart shaped locket. The next day, they take the three bodies to the morgue. It is revealed that the skeleton corpse that they found is Lara Luna, whom her mother identified through her locket.  Lara  is driving with her younger sister Joy  on the same dirt road. As they drive, they pass by a teenage boy  walking along the road and a few feet away from him, their car overheats. They get out and then ask him where they can get water and the boy tells them that he'll give them water by his house, which is the same house Luis and the others found years later. As they wait for him outside his house, Lara senses that something is wrong and tells Joy that they should leave. As they try to, the boy comes out and hits them with a wooden stick. Lara wakes up a few hours later, with her foot chained to a bed post. She hears Joy's screams for help and begs him to let her and her sister go. The boy takes Joy down to the basement and proceeds to savagely beat her. A few minutes later, he returns Joy to her room beside her sister's. Lara apologizes to Joy that she couldn't protect her but Joy tells her that it's not her fault. As the boy comes to take Lara, she puts up a fight and scratches his neck. For now, the boy leaves her alone. Lara notices that he dropped the keys to her chains and proceeds to take it. She tries to search for Joy but notices that she's no longer there. She manages to sneak out of the house and falls into a pit which has corpses dumped in it. She sees that one is Joy. As she cries, she apologizes once again and finally leaves. The boy, meanwhile, has taken their car and proceeds to chase Lara with it. Eventually, he gently runs her over. As Lara tries to crawl away, The boy knocks her out and wraps a plastic bag around her head and ties a belt around her neck and her hands. As he drives back to his house, Lara suddenly awakens, causing the boy to crash. He leaves the car and watches it and Lara burn. Back to the present day, Luis takes the officers back to the same house to look for Ella. As he and Officer Allan scope around, they find a picture of the old owners of the house. As Officer Allan goes to search someplace else, Luis finds Ella, who wasn't noticed by Officer Greg. She keeps yelling at him to 'let us go home' and finally passes out as Luis holds her in his arms. Luis takes her to the rendezvous point and takes her to the ambulance. As Ella's father tries to talk to her, she says that their car stalled due to overheating and tells him that they asked a teenage boy for water, revealing that Ella is possessed by Lara. Luis and Officer Allan decide to return to the house.  A young boy  lives with his family in the house deep in the woods. As he looks out of his window, he notices a girl named Martha  looking for his mother. The girl was there to see if the family needed their laundry doing. It is revealed that the boy isn't allowed to come out of the house and his abusive mother Carmela  tells Martha to come back tomorrow morning. Mistaking her son's conversation with Martha as an attempt to go out, Carmela locks him in a cabinet. During the evening, the boy's father , who is a preacher, comes home and lets him out of the cabinet. The reason behind his isolation is because his parents believe that the outside world is full of sin. The reason behind Carmela's bitterness is because the family is struggling financially and her husband refuses to ask money from his congregation. The next day, the boy spots Martha doing their laundry. As he comes down and watches her by the door, she invites him to come out to play but he tells her that he's not allowed to come outside. Wanting him to experience some fun, Martha comes inside with a bucket of soap and they blow bubbles. Carmela comes down and is enraged at the sight. As Martha tries to stop Carmela from hurting the boy, Carmela accidentally knocks her into the door post and Martha dies. As the boy tries to wipe the blood away, he faints. Later that night, the boy wakes up and sees his mother hugging another man. As he comes down, his father tells him to wait upstairs so he and his mother can talk. It is revealed then that Carmela plans to leave her husband and the boy for the man. The boy's father tries to convince her not to do it, but she is stubborn and decides to go through with it. As the boy was listening, he passed out by his bed. The next morning his mother woke him up to have breakfast. When he came downstairs, his father tells him that Carmela left them and his father starts to throw up due to drunkenness. The boy adamantly insists that his mother is still there and in a fit of rage, his father shows him Carmela's corpse, revealing that his father killed Carmela. Frightened, the boy locked himself in the cabinet where he sees Martha's corpse. His father tries to get him out of the cabinet but when he sees Martha's corpse, he is shocked and has a breakdown. The next morning, the boy comes out of the cabinet and when he enters his parents' room, he sees that his father hanged himself. It is revealed that the boy didn't go out of the house until he became a teenager and that the boy was the one who killed Joy and Lara Luna.  Back to the present, Luis and Officer Allan arrive at the house and when Allan finds a room bound with a new padlock, Luis orders him to beat the door down. When he does so, he sees that the room is a bed room. As they look around, Officer Allan notices Luis' medal. Luis knocks him out, wraps his head with a sheet and seals it with a belt around his neck, revealing to the audience that the boys in the second and third parts of the movie was none other than Luis himself. He walks back to the rendezvous point as other cops search the house. As he walks, he keeps on muttering 'I'm sorry, Mama. It won't happen again.' Back at the rendezvous point, Ella's father asks her who was the boy and Ella, still possessed by Lara, points at Luis. As the Chief of Police calls out to him, Luis shoots the chief two times in the chest. He gets in his car and drives away but his car stalls. As he tries to get out, the ghosts of Joy and Lara are with him in his car. He reaches for his gun and it is shown that Lara is forcing his hand to point his gun to his chin. As he mutters 'Mama, I'm sorry', Lara forces him to shoot himself. A few minutes later, the other cops find Luis in his car, dead. The film ends with Luis as a young boy, finally able to go outside of his house and be free from his mother.\"},\n",

Bond and Eve chase the killer, mercenary Patrice, and attempt to recover the disk. During the chase, Bond is shot in the shoulder. While fighting Patrice, Bond is accidentally shot by Eve and is later considered \"missing, presumed killed\". The head of MI6, M, comes under political pressure to retire during a meeting with the Intelligence and Security Committee Chairman, Gareth Mallory. On her return from the meeting, MI6 is hacked and an explosion occurs in the offices, killing a number of MI6 employees. Bond, having used his perceived death to retire, learns of the attack and returns to London. Shrapnel taken from his earlier shoulder wound helps identify Patrice, and Bond tracks the mercenary to Shanghai. Meanwhile, five NATO agents are killed after their identities are exposed, and further releases are threatened. After Patrice assassinates a target, he and Bond fight. Patrice falls to his death before Bond can learn of his employer. Searching Patrice\\'s equipment, Bond finds a gambling chip which leads him to a casino. Sévérine, who Bond saw earlier during the assassination, warns him that he is about to be killed, but promises to help him if he will kill her employer. Bond beats his attackers and joins Sévérine on her boat. They travel to an island, where they are taken prisoner by the crew and delivered to Sévérine\\'s employer, Raoul Silva. A former MI6 agent working under M, Silva holds her responsible for his torture and imprisonment by the Chinese. Silva kills Sévérine, but Bond overpowers his guards and captures Silva for extraction to the UK.

The trio are only lightly armed, but they improvise a series of booby traps. When Silva\\'s men arrive, Bond, M and Kincade fight off the first assault, although M is wounded. Silva arrives by helicopter{{cite web}} with a second wave, and Bond sends M and Kincade off through a secret tunnel at the back of a priest hole to a chapel on the grounds. The second assault uses firepower from the helicopter, and Silva throws incendiary grenades into the building.

Carmen helps Joe by getting the gang to allow Joe to help them execute a plan that she has devised to blackmail a United States military attaché named Drayton . Although the plan is sanctioned by Rollo, the fixer of the gang, Michael , puts pressure on Joe to try to get Carmen to change her mind about the viability of plan. Michael learns that Joe and Carmen have been intimate with each other behind Rollo's back and attempts to use this information to influence Joe. Rollo ultimately does learn of Carmen's infidelity and is killed by Joe.

       "  'summary': 'In need of money to help her divorced boyfriend Sam Loomis , Marion Crane , a secretary in Phoenix, Arizona, steals $40,000 from one of her employer\\'s clients and flees in her car. En route to Sam\\'s California home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her, becomes suspicious of her agitated state and begins to follow her. When she trades her car for another one at a car dealership, he notes the new vehicle\\'s details. By the time Marion returns to the road, there is a heavy rainstorm which prompts her to spend the night at the isolated Bates Motel rather than drive in the rain. The young owner Norman Bates  tells Marion he rarely has customers because of his location along an older, less-traveled highway, and mentions he lives with his mother in the grim-looking house overlooking the motel. He then shyly invites Marion to have supper with him. She overhears Norman arguing with his unseen mother about his supposed sexual interest in Marion, and during the meal, Marion suggests he institutionalize his mother, making him become aggressive. He admits he would like to do so, but does not want to abandon her. Marion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. As she undresses in her room, Norman watches through a peephole in his office wall. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion flushes her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. Suddenly, the shadowy figure of a woman enters the bathroom and stabs Marion to death. Norman finds the corpse, and immediately assumes that his mother committed the murder. He cleans the bathroom and places Marion\\'s body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions—including the money—in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp. Shortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion\\'s sister Lila  and private detective Milton Arbogast , who has been hired to find her and recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who lies unconvincingly about Marion having left weeks before. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila and tells her he will contact her again after hopefully questioning Norman\\'s mother. Arbogast enters Norman\\'s house and is attacked by the same female figure who killed Marion, who slashes his face with a large kitchen knife, causing him to fall down the stairs, and then stabs him to death. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar so no one could find her. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room. Against her will, Norman carries her down to the fruit cellar, though the viewer is not shown Norman\\'s mother in full. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window, and reveals that Norman\\'s mother had died ten years earlier. Norman had found her dead alongside her married lover; an apparent murder–suicide. When Chambers dismisses Lila and Sam\\'s concerns over Arbogast\\'s disappearance, the two decide to search the motel themselves. Posing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion\\'s cabin, where they find a scrap of paper with \"$40,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house to search for his mother. Sam suggests Norman killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new hotel. Realizing Lila is missing, Norman knocks Sam unconscious and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the hideous mummified body of Mrs. Bates and screams. Seconds later, Norman rushes in, wearing his mother\\'s clothes and a wig, and carrying a knife. Sam arrives just in time to overpower Bates and save Lila. After Norman\\'s arrest, forensic psychiatrist Dr. Fred Richmond  tells Sam and Lila that Mrs. Bates is alive in Norman\\'s fractured psyche. After the death of Norman\\'s father, the pair lived in an unhealthy state of emotional co-dependance. When his mother found a lover, however, Norman was consumed with jealousy and murdered both of them. Wracked with guilt, he tried to \"erase the crime\" by bringing his mother \"back to life\" in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body, and developed a split personality in which the two personas &mdash; Norman and \"Mother\" &mdash; coexist; when he is Mother, he acts, talks and dresses as she would. Marion is revealed to have been Mother\\'s third victim, the first two also having been attractive young women; Mother is as jealous of Norman as he is of her, and so \"she\" kills anyone he feels attracted to. His psychosis protects him from knowing about other crimes committed after his mother\\'s death. Norman sits in a cell, his mind dominated by the Mother persona. She says that she will prove to the authorities that she is harmless by refusing to swat a fly on Norman\\'s hand. He then forms a smile. Marion\\'s car is recovered from the swamp.'},\n",

       "  'summary': \"The story revolves around two Paris police officers: Léo Vrinks , head of the BRI and Denis Klein , head of the BRB. Both want to catch a vicious gang of armoured-car robbers that have killed nine people. But when their immediate superior, the chief of the Paris criminal police , announces that he would soon retire, the rivalry pushes Klein to play dirty in order to get the promotion. Vrinks is a good investigative detective with a loyal cadre of detectives and officers, as well as a stable of unsavory informants he has cultivated over the years. Klein, who has questionable ethics, is not so accomplished. Vrinks also helps people, in particular a prostitute who is raped and beaten by a criminal who was robbing the bar that she was employed at. Vrinks and his team kidnap the man and drive him out to the forest for punishment: the gangster is stripped naked and given a mock execution, before being pushed into an open grave and warned to never go near her again. Unfortunately, Vrinks' methods catch up with him when he is tricked by Silien , an incarcerated informant on day release, into being the unwitting getaway driver in the murder of one of Silien's criminal colleagues . However, the assassinated gangster was also one of Klein's informants. In a quid pro quo exchange of providing Silien with an alibi and to buy Vrinks' silence, he tells the detective where the armoured-car gang is hiding. Vrinks and his team stake out the factory, with Klein's team acting as backup. But when they are on the verge of catching all the robbers after patient planning and surveillance, Klein ignores procedure and radio orders, and drunkenly comes out of hiding. The gang use this to spark a firefight, which results in the death of Vrinks' best friend and the kidnapping of a detective as a hostage. An internal investigation is launched into the botched operation. But Klein avoids censure for his behaviour by finding a witness to Silien's murder  who saw Vrinks at the murder scene. Vrinks is arrested and thrown into jail by a cop-hating judge. Klein is exonerated at the police inquiry because Vrinks' evidence is ruled inadmissible, and one of his friends leads the Internal Affairs investigation. While Vrinks is in prison his wife, Camille , is contacted by Silien. They agree to meet but the phone call is secretly being tapped by Klein's team, who follow her. When Silien gets into her vehicle, the police move in but the criminal panics and there is a car chase. Klein purposely slams his car into Camille's, forcing it off the road. The crash kills Vrinks' wife and Silien. But Klein uses the circumstances to clear his name again. First he uses Silien's gun to shoot Camille before using his own gun to shoot Silien. It now looks like the informant shot Camille in the car, causing the them to veer off the road and Klein shot back in self defence. Seven years later, Vrinks is released from prison for his silence in Silien's killings. Klein, who has become chief of the Paris criminal police, has kept people silent by handing out promotions or by forcing others to retire or transfer. Vrinks goes to see an old colleague who quit the police and works at a club. While at the club, a confrontation occurs and Vrinks' old colleague is threatened by men who seem strangely familiar. Vrinks then has an emotional reunion with his now grown up daughter, telling her that he is going far away, but first he has to take care of unfinished business. Vrinks gets a gun in a plan to take revenge on Klein who is attending the annual Parisian police ball. Meanwhile his old police colleague has been attacked by the men who were ejected from the club. In the assault they find out the name of the other policeman who left their friend in the forest. Meanwhile, using a stolen police ID, Vrinks gets into the venue and confronts Klein in the lavatory. Meanwhile, the men who were ejected from the club follow Vrinks to the soiree, and wait ominously outside. Klein explains that Camille was already dead when he shot her, and Vrinks realises what a sad man Klein has become and suggests he kill himself with the gun that he brought. After Vrinks leaves, Klein follows him into the street shouting obscenities and blaming Vrinks for his wife's death. But a motorcycle pulls up and a man shoots Klein in the head. It is then revealed that Vrinks' old colleague said Klein's name instead. Vrinks meets his daughter at the airport. The film ends with them queuing at the security gate at the start of their trip and a new life abroad.\"},\n",

       "  'summary': \"Jeeva  is a typical Chennai youngster. His father Pragasam , a call taxi driver, showers love and affection on him. They lead a simple life and derive happiness in whatever they do. One day, Jeeva comes across Priya  at the wedding of their mutual friend. The two fall for each other. He doesn't tell her about his feelings and knows that she likes him. He plays hard to get until their mutual friend tells Priya about Jeeva's infatuation. Jeeva tries to make her become more independent. One day he goes up to Priya's father against her pleas and tells him of their love. Jeeva eventually secures a job as that is one of the requirements for him to marry Priya. Eventually Priya becomes acquainted with Jeeva's family and is accepted as the future bride. When all seems to go well, a murder attempt on Jeeva’s father disturbs everything. Jeeva’s father had witnessed a girl being taken by a group of teenagers in his taxi. The girl gets raped and killed. To get rid of the body of the girl and her boyfriend they hack both the bodies into small pieces and dumps them in random dump-yards in the city. When police accidentally recovers the head of the girl from a dumpyard, it is reported on TV. Jeeva's father suspects that the head recovered might belong to a girl who was taken by guys who boarded his taxi. So he decides to knock on the doors of justice and confirms to the police that the girl in his taxi and the murdered girl are the same. Sensing trouble, the gang plans to murder him as he has seen their faces. So they go to Pey Babu, the uncle of one of the teenagers, a local criminal who is adept at coming up with plans for murdering people. They conduct reconnaissance of Jeeva's father and their home. They also come to know about the upcoming marriage of Jeeva's sister when Pey Babu, under the guise of delivering a Pamphlet, takes a good look at Jeeva's family. Pey Babu assumes that Jeeva's family has to venture outside their home for wedding arrangements. The gang follows Jeeva's family to a wedding card shop where the gang hears the owner of the shop asking Jeeva and his father to come back in a couple of days to collect the printed cards. Now that Pey Babu knows the exact location and time of where Jeeva's father is going to be, he comes up with a detailed plan for murder. When Jeeva and his father return to the shop after two days, the gang starts a commotion in the crowded street and in the ensuing confusion, one of the gang stabs Jeeva's father with a Poisoned Glass SHRAPNEL. During the murder Jeeva notices and identifies one of the Gang members as he looked like the same person that his father described during the previous investigation of the girl's Murder. The death of his father shatters Jeeva. The investigation of his father's murder brings the police to Jeeva's home where they ask him whether he had seen any suspicious person in his neighborhood in the days before his father's murder. Jeeva denies seeing any suspicious person although he later reveals to his friend that he indeed has seen a strange guy delivering pamphlets to his home and the guy during his father's murder. When his friend inquires why he did not say anything to the Police, Jeeva replies the guys do not deserve a police investigation and court trial. The heinous crime they committed, hacking a girl into pieces, deserves much harsher punishment. And he says that he is going to personally punish the gang not because they killed his father but because of the heinous and psychopathic nature of their crimes. He sets out on a mission to identify the culprits and goes running around the town baying for their blood. Jeeva seeks the help of his friend Kaasimedu Kutti Nadesan, a chennai gangster, who Jeeva got acquainted with in the past. Nadesan with his influence asks his gang to bring all the Guys who plans for murder in Chennai, so that Jeeva can identify him. It turns out there are only four people who can plan for murder in Chennai including Pey Babu. Nadesan interrogates the first person in front of Jeeva. The next is Pey Babu, but Jeeva gets distracted, but turns back just in time to look at Pey Babu and identifies him as the person who delivered Pamphlets to his home days before his dad's murder. Now a chase ensues and Jeeva successfully captures and subdues Pey. Now Jeeva coerces Pey into taking him to where the Teenage gang is. Both Pey and Jeeva goes to the road in front of the college where the five teenagers study. But before he can get hold of them, the gangs gets alerted and start a commotion by throwing cool drink bottles in the crowd. In the ensuing melee, Pey gets stabbed by one of the gang and Jeeva gets a clear look at the guy who stabbed Pey. So Jeeva chases him and beats him senseless . But the teenager gets killed by a train when he tries to escape the clutches of Jeeva. Jeeva subsequently goes to the dead teenager's funeral hoping that his friends will come there. The gang arrives but sees Jeeva before he sees them . They leave the funeral and to get drunk goes to one of the beaches which coincidentally is the same place Nadesan returns back after going to the sea. The gang argues among themselves how their friend got killed by Jeeva and how they should avenge him. At the same time Jeeva calls Nadesan on his cell phone to use his influence to investigate about the friends of the Dead teenager. The gang while arguing starts shouting which distracts Nadesan and looking at them Nadesan asks Jeeva about the how the gang looks like. Sensing that Jeeva's description matches the gang on the beach, Nadesan goes to inquire them while giving the phone to another one of his group to give Jeeva, the directions to the beach. During the inquiry Nadesan confirms the Killers and the gang on the beach are the same but before he can do anything the gang clubs one of Nadesan's group and runs into a nearby area with dilapidated houses. Nadesan and two of his group grabs weapons and goes after them but they are killed easily as they are outnumbered by the four teenagers who hide and attack and finish them off one by one. Jeeva arrives just a few minutes late to see that Nadesan and his group slaughtered. Now it is up to Jeeva to face four guys armed with blades and avenge his father's death. What follows is an intense, gut wrenching fight for survival between the gang and Jeeva. After a struggle Jeeva triumphs over the four rapists and buries them alive on the beach.\"},\n",

Years later, a teenage Sharon  and her father live under the assumed identities of Heather and Harry Mason respectively.

Heather returns home and finds a message painted on the wall: \"Come to Silent Hill\". Accompanied by Vincent, she collects the amulet and the pair flee to Silent Hill as police arrive. There, Vincent reveals that he is cult leader Claudia Wolf\\'s  son, sent to bring Heather to the cult, but he is unwilling to because she is the good half of Alessa. The town transforms into the nightmare dimension, and Vincent informs Heather that she is the one responsible for altering the reality and directs Heather to Claudia\\'s father Leonard Wolf, who is locked in an asylum.

Jack calls his servant, Rochester  to get his white suit, which Rochester is wearing at the time. Jack tells the valet that his rental period is up  and he needs the suit because he is taking Mary Livingstone out for her birthday, and, true to character, is looking for a good cheap restaurant. While waiting for Mary, Jack decides to count his cheese in a basement vault. Using a coin on a string, he opens the lock, which appears to be a coin-operated lock from a pay toilet. As soon as he walks through the door, he takes a cane from a nail on the wall and starts humming We\\'re in the Money. When he reaches the bottom of the stairs, he reaches through a hole and trips a razor blade hanging above the passageway like a guillotine.

What do you think we\\'ll do with the Kaiser?\" Mary arrives while Jack is inspecting his cheese vault, and he emerges wondering who has been pilfering his gorgonzola.

Jack and Mary putter off in his Maxwell with Rochester behind the wheel until they reach the Kit Kat Club by following the arrows pointing to it. While enroute, Mary asks for champagne, while Jack says that he prefers a good \"mousecatel\". Unbeknownst to them, the \"club\" is actually the maw of a real cat, and as they enter, the cat\\'s mouth closes on them. Jack cries: \"Help!

Imagine- Mary and me as two little mice trapped inside a cat\\'s mouth!

Buckner is afraid to speak up because the Van Holdens are a powerful family, and Jeremy pays him $10,000 for taking the fall. Matt moves to the United Kingdom to live with his sister Shannon , her husband Steve Dunham  and their young son, Ben . There, Matt meets Steve\\'s brother, Pete , a loud and thuggish Cockney who runs a local football hooligan firm - a group of football supporters that arranges fights after matches - and teaches at a local school. Steve asks Pete to take Matt to a football match between West Ham United and Birmingham City, though Pete is reluctant to take a \"Yank\" to a football match, because of the xenophobic nature of his friends. He is persuaded because Steve will only give the money Pete needs to Matt. After defeating Matt in a fight, Pete decides to take Matt to the football match, thinking he might learn a thing or two. Matt meets Pete\\'s friends and his firm in the Abbey, their local pub. The hooligans all befriend Matt, with the exception of Pete\\'s rather obnoxious right-hand man, Bovver . After a few pints of lager, they head to Upton Park for the match. After the match, Pete, Bovver, and the other firm members agree to go and fight some Birmingham fans, but Matt decides that it is not for him and tells Pete he is going to take the train home. On his way back to the underground, Matt is jumped by three Birmingham fans, who nearly give him a \\'Chelsea Grin\\', but he is rescued by some GSE members, who are on their way to a larger fight. Though grossly outnumbered, the GSE manage to hold their ground until reinforcements chase off the Birmingham firm. Matt does well in his first true fight and is inducted into the GSE. After a row with Steve, Matt moves in with Pete, and the two exchange stories. The GSE firm then head to an away game against Manchester United. Matt was not meant to come but ends up sneaking onto the train. Whilst on the train they are pre-warned that 40 Manchester United firm members are waiting for them at the station. Bovver hits the emergency stop button which allows the GSE to get off at an earlier stop . Having failed to find a taxi, they persuade a van driver to take them into Manchester. Matt sits in the front of the van with the driver; the rest of the GSE are in the rear. As the van approaches the Man Utd. fans, Matt tells them that they are moving equipment for a Hugh Grant film, so the fans let them through. When past them, he stops the van, opens up the back, and the GSE charge out to attack the United firm members. They win the fight and run away singing \"There\\'s your famous GSE!\" It is soon revealed to Matt that the GSE\\'s sworn enemy is Millwall\\'s firm, led by Tommy Hatcher ([[Geoff Bell , with whom Bovver makes negotiations after getting jealous of Matt. After one of the members of the firm see Matt meeting his father, a renowned journalist for The Times, for lunch, they assume Matt is a \"journo\" as well. Bovver informs Pete of this, and, when Steve finds out, he goes to the Abbey to warn Matt. Matt finds out that Steve used to be \"The Major\" of the GSE but quit following a match against Millwall, to which Tommy Hatcher brought along his 12-year-old son. The boy was killed in the ensuing fight by members of the GSE, causing Tommy Hatcher to \"lose it,\" blaming Steve and the GSE for his son\\'s death. After witnessing this tragedy, Steve left football hooliganism for good. At that moment, Bovver and Pete arrive, and there is a massive argument in the Abbey, in which Bovver comes out humiliated. Infuriated, Bovver goes to Millwall\\'s local and asks Tommy Hatcher to ambush GSE at the Abbey. Initially reluctant, Tommy Hatcher agrees upon learning that Steve Dunham is there. Pete angerly confronts Matt in the bathroom over the covering-up of his real identity. The Millwall firm then crash the Abbey, and petrol bomb the bar. Upon arriving, Tommy Hatcher confronts Steve. Steve\\'s attempt to convince Tommy Hatcher that he is no longer involved in the GSE only further reminds Hatcher of his son, and he stabs Steve in the neck with a broken bottle, telling him that if he dies tonight then they are both even. Bovver, who had been knocked out by Tommy Hatcher, comes round just in time to help Steve, who is badly injured. At the hospital, Pete blasts Bovver for his betrayal. Shannon decides to head back to the United States to ensure the safety of her family. In the aftermath, the two firms meet near the Millennium Dome for a bloody and all-out brawl. Matt and Bovver show up to fight for the GSE, but during the fight, Matt\\'s sister, Shannon, turns up with their son, and are attacked by a Millwall hooligan. Matt and Bovver come to their rescue. Pete notices that Tommy Hatcher is approaching the car, and distracts Tommy by taunting him to \"finish him off.\" When Tommy Hatcher declares to have finished with him, Pete then retorts that Tommy Hatcher was to blame for his son\\'s death, having failed to protect him, shouting \"he was your son!\". Tommy Hatcher, driven to insanity, attacks and beats Pete to death, all the while shouting out a variation of the words to the chant \\'Only a poor little Hammer,\\' using it as an analogy for Pete\\'s condition. The fight completely halts at this point, and Hatcher is eventually pulled off Pete by some of his friends as he breaks down in tears. Everyone on both sides gathers around Pete\\'s dead body in shock, with Bovver sobbing at his side. Matt returns to the United States and confronts Jeremy Van Holden in a restaurant toilet, where Jeremy is snorting cocaine. Jeremy arrogantly tells Matt to leave during a brief discussion in which he admits to his identity as the cocaine stash\\'s true owner. Matt then pulls out a tape recorder and plays back what Jeremy just said, saying that it is his \"ticket back to Harvard.\" Jeremy lunges at him to try to get the tape, but Matt casually reverses the attack and raises his fist as if to punch Jeremy. He does not do so, instead walking out with a smile as Jeremy collapses to the floor, defeated. The film ends with Matt walking down the street outside the restaurant singing \"I\\'m Forever Blowing Bubbles.\"'},\n",

Aunt Sally  attempts to defend MaryAnn, but it fails. The church\\'s pastor, Reverend Lewis  is too afraid of the other church members to let her stay. MaryAnn and Darrin are last seen saying goodbye to Aunt Sally, as they sadly wave goodbye to each other. Twenty-three years later, Darrin  has grown up to become a successful advertising executive in New York City with a bad habit of lying. His best friend and secretary, Rosa Lopez  does a good job at keeping his credit problems under control. However, Darrin has achieved so much under false pretenses and faked his college degree and high school diploma. Darrin also lied about being the son of a congressman, and his lies soon catch up with him and get him in trouble with his paranoid boss  and Darrin loses his job. After being tracked down by a private investigator, Darrin finds out that Aunt Sally has died. Darrin returns to his hometown of Monte Carlo, Georgia and looks back on both comical and heartbreaking memories of MaryAnn and the experiences they had together. When Darrin arrives, he finds a new friendship in Lucious , the town\\'s happy-go-lucky cab driver. Lucious is obsessed with women\\'s booties and even proclaims himself a \"Booty expert\" and \"Bootyologist\". After the funeral, Darrin learns from the Reverend that Aunt Sally stated in her will that he must direct the church choir and enter the annual \"Gospel Explosion\" competition and win the prize money of $10,000 and Aunt Sally\\'s stock in the company that produces the show which is worth $150,000. The main problem Darrin must deal with is the wicked church treasurer, Paulina , who is also the Reverend\\'s sister and the same woman who bullied MaryAnn into leaving Monte Carlo. Paulina despises Darrin because of MaryAnn and she also thinks he stole her \"dream job\" as choir director, as she has waited years for Sally to pass away. Later that night, Darrin and Lucious go to a night club, where Darrin eventually reunites with his old childhood friend named Lilly , who happens to be the tavern\\'s headliner. Darrin first hears Lilly sing at the club when she performs \"Fever\", and attempt to flirt with her, but Lilly coldly rejects Darrin by saying she has a jealous \"boyfriend\" named Dean. After many failed auditions, Darrin finally finds good singers, but most of them want to get paid. He cons them into the choir by saying that he will pay them half of the prize money, but secretly has no intentions of paying anybody. After a stressful effort, Darrin finally convinces Lilly to join the choir, and also bonds with Dean thereafter, who is actually her 9-year-old son she had out of wedlock. Later on, Paulina reveals that Darrin forgot to enter the choir into the auditions. Luckily, the audition judge, Luther Washington , who is also the town\\'s prison warden, lets them perform in a show for his prisoners when the booked act fails to arrive. Thanks to Lilly\\'s beautiful looks and voice, the choir performs well and Washington lets them into the competition. Washington also lets Darrin use three convicts who can sing well. The three convicts are Bee-Z Briggs, Lightfoot, and Mr. Johnson ([[T-Bone . After weeks of success, the choir has become more popular, more people have joined the church and the choir. Darrin also begins dating Lilly. However, Paulina takes a message for Darrin in a phone call from Rosa and learns of his past troubles, and intends on exposing him the first chance she gets. The next afternoon at a church barbecue, Paulina deliberately reveals Darrin\\'s secrets with a polite demeanor, in order to make herself look innocent. Lilly is furious and heartbroken about this and the people who he promised money to begin to panic, and tells Darrin that she doesn\\'t care what he does, she was only using him because he was using her. Since Lilly wants nothing to do with him, Darrin decides to quit and return to New York, where he has been offered his job back. Darrin goes back and gets a new condo and a promotion, and comes to realize that none of these things mean anything without Lilly and the choir. Darrin quits his job and returns to Monte Carlo to reconcile with Lilly. Darrin and Lilly recruits Lucious and the Reverend and they rush down to the Gospel Explosion to join the choir for the performance. When Darrin and Lilly arrive, they manage to convince the others to vote Paulina out of the choir, giving Darrin his position as director back. Before their performance begins, Darrin tells Lilly that she inspired him to name the choir The Fighting Temptations. After an outstanding performance, the choir wins the competition, but before ending his acceptance speech, Darrin proposes to Lilly. Eighteen months later, they are married with a baby. Paulina is welcomed back into the choir after having dropped her hypocritical ways. As the film ends, Lucious asks Darrin and Lilly\\'s new baby: \"You know I\\'m your daddy, right?\", but Lilly\\'s grandfather hears this and gives Lucious a mean stare.

       "  'summary': 'Gerry Conlon  is shown in Belfast stripping lead from roofs when the security forces home in on the district with armoured cars, and the dustbin lids beat out a riot. His father later saves him from IRA justice, as they are about to kneecap him, and he is sent off to London for his own good. There he finds a squat, to explore, as he puts it, \"free love and drugs.\" The evening when he walks off with some money from a prostitute\\'s flat is when an explosion at a pub in Guildford kills five people  and wounds 75. Conlon returns to Belfast to share his fortune. His family home is raided by the British Army and Royal Ulster Constabulary who arrest him, and immediately place him on a military flight to the mainland UK. Gerry and his friend are interrogated by police who torture and threaten them until both finally agree to sign a confession after being held for up to seven days under the Prevention of Terrorism Act. When his father Giuseppe traveled from Belfast to help his son, he was arrested at the family\\'s relatives\\' home in England. In the subsequent trial, his aunt\\'s family  are convicted of supporting the bombing on the basis of unsubstantiated nitroglycerine traces, and the four, including Gerry, are sentenced to long terms of imprisonment. His time in prison shows a progression from a bitter son who rails at his father to an awakening when he discovers the real perpetrator of the bombing in the same facility. When this man leads a prison protest and then sets a hated prison guard on fire, Gerry is the one who saves the man with a blanket. Gerry takes over the fight for justice himself when his father dies in custody. A campaigning lawyer  who has been investigating the case on behalf of Giuseppe in the wake of public campaigns demanding the release of the accused has a break when she tries to access his father\\'s file and is able to look instead at Gerry\\'s, finding that vital police documents in the file are marked \"Not to be shown to the Defence\". During the course of their appeal, the production of these documents leads to a triumphant scene in court when she produces the evidence that the police officers have been lying all the way through, which leads to the exoneration and release of all the Four.'},\n",

Pusuing them and intent on capture are members of eastern and western governments, the military-industrial complex, a private paramilitary group and a squad of South Slavic mercenaries.

His fiancée Renuka  wants to know the cause of his suicide and decides to do a bit of investigation. She meets different people who had some role in Gopi's life and gets to hear their versions about Gopi. All their testimonials lead to her concluding on what Gopi's reasons were. The ideal attitude that Gopi possess against the odds provides the fuel for Renuka's journey. As Renuka gets more closer to knowing Gopi, the man who led a very normal life posed an even more difficult question as to the cause of his death. Finally she understands that Gopi committed suicide out of the shame of being alive in such a merciless society. The director successfully portrays different evils in the society and the film, in its course way beyond a regional movie as it embeds different cultures. The film is also for the way the story is told, the Rashomon way.\"}]"

The Martian society has become largely matriarchal, with women in most positions of authority.

With their team leader Helena Bradock  murdered, Ballard must fight off the attacking miners, escape the town, and destroy the ghosts, if possible. Unfortunately, her intentions are complicated by the fact that killing a possessed human merely releases the Martian spirit to possess another human.
